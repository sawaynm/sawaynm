### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


  Yo, what's good? ğŸ‘‹

**sawaynm/sawaynm** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ spot 'cause this `README.md` (right here) shows up on your screen like a stage on my GitHub profile.

Peep into my universe, all wired up and lit:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m on this grind, crafting beats in the lab, where my code and rhymes collide, trying to turn the digital mundane into gold.
- ğŸŒ± Sprouting knowledge in this concrete jungle, Iâ€™m vibing with the new age scrolls, learning to script the future, verse by verse.
- ğŸ‘¯ Looking to jam with minds that spark, creators and coders, artists with that - ğŸ¤” Seeking wizards in this game of codes, those with potions for the latest tech spells, to conjure up the next unseen world.
- ğŸ’¬ Hit me up about flipping bits into beats,  exchange.
- ğŸ“« Holler at me:
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns:â€”'Cause in this digital dojo, we keep it 100, respecting every soul's tag.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Ever hear about that time I 5coded non-stop,  rhythm to life.
